# Jekyll / GitHub Pages version of mohundro.com

This is the source code for the old Jekyll version of my website, [mohundro.com](https://mohundro.com). This repo is no longer updated as I have a Next.js version of my site in another repo, which is why I've archived it.

This version of the site is built with Jekyll and is running on GitHub Pages.
