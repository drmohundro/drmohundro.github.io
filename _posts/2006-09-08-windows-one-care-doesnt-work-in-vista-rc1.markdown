Windows One Care doesn't work in RC1, but they've still included it in the "Offers from Microsoft" section of Vista's welcome center. That's sort of annoying, because I've already signed up for Windows One Care, but now I can't use it in the system that actually is trying to get me to use it!

**UPDATE:** [Now it does](/blog/2006/10/10/new-windows-onecare-beta-and-it-works-in-vista/)!
