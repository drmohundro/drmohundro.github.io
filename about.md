My name is David, but a lot of people call me Mo. It comes from my last
name... **Mo**hundro. You get it, right?

I'm a software developer/artisan/craftsman/engineer/architect working at [Clear
Function](http://clearfunction.com/) in the Memphis, TN area. I mostly write in
either C# or Ruby but I try to work with a wide variety of languages and
technologies. I'm a big fan of Swift, JavaScript and PowerShell, too.  I use
Vim (or at least something with good Vim keybindings) for all of my code
editing needs. I use both Windows and OS X quite a bit and enjoy dabbling in
Linux occasionally. I like technology.  Use what works for you!

I'm an occasional speaker. I've presented quite a few presentations on
PowerShell to .NET User Groups in the area as well as topics such as
JavaScript. I've also presented on Swift and .NET multithreading.

I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father. I've got three daughters, two by
[birth](/blog/2011/06/24/introducing-daila-joy/) and one by
[adoption](/blog/2014/04/01/adoption-and-my-second-daughter/). I like
[video games](http://doctormo.tumblr.com/), movies, books, and
music. I also enjoy traveling.
